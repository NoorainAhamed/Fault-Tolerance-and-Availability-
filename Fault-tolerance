## FAULT - TOLERANCE

Here are the step-by-step instructions to create multiple drives (partitions) on Windows 7 using the built-in Disk Management tool:

1. Back Up Important Data

Partitioning usually doesn’t erase existing data if done carefully, but a backup is always safest.

2. Open Disk Management

Click Start → Control Panel → System and Security → Administrative Tools → Computer Management.

In the left pane, select Disk Management under “Storage.”

3. Shrink the Existing Partition

You need unallocated space before you can create new drives.

Right-click the main drive (usually C:) and choose Shrink Volume.

Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB (e.g., 50 000 MB ≈ 50 GB) and click Shrink.

You’ll now see Unallocated space.

4. Create a New Partition (Drive)

Right-click the Unallocated space and select New Simple Volume.

The wizard opens:

Specify Volume Size → set size for this partition.

Assign Drive Letter or Path → choose a letter (e.g., D).

Format Partition → select NTFS and choose a volume label (name).

Click Finish. Windows formats the new partition and shows it as a new drive.

5. Repeat for Additional Drives

If you want more than one new drive:

Either shrink the C: drive again if there’s more space, or

Create multiple smaller volumes from any remaining Unallocated space.

6. Verify

Open Computer (Windows Explorer). You should now see the new drives (e.g., D:, E:, etc.), ready for use.
